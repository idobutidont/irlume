// Wedged-capture watchdog (issue #141).

// Cooperative cancellation (#117 stage 2) checks a stop signal before opening
// the device and between whole captures, which covers everything that reaches a
// yield point. A capture already inside a V4L2 call or an inference session has
// no such point: if the driver never returns, the worker never comes back, and
// an authentication queued behind it waits indefinitely. No amount of scheduling
// fixes that, because there is nothing to schedule against.
//
// systemd is already supervising this process, so the deadline lives there
// rather than in a bespoke watchdog: `WatchdogSec` in the unit, and a ping from
// here while the worker is healthy. Stopping the ping is what asks for the
// restart, so a wedge ends as a bounded restart instead of an indefinite hang.
// PAM already treats a missing daemon as "fall back to the password", so the
// failure mode is one the login path handles.
//
// Health is about the WORKER, not the process. A process that is alive while its
// camera thread is stuck in the kernel is exactly the case this exists for, so
// pinging from a bare timer would report a wedged daemon as healthy.

// Per-uid refusal throttle (issue #142).
//
// #117 capped CONCURRENCY at MAX_CONNECTION_THREADS but not the RATE. Measured
// 2026-07-27 with one client holding a uid's camera slot and 8 spinning behind
// it: 10,501 refusals a second, the daemon burning 305% of one core, and an
// ordinary `ListProfiles` going from 903ms to 4146ms. Connection threads peaked
// at 44 against a cap of 64, so exhaustion was never the mechanism; CPU was, and
// the cost is paid per CONNECTION, before the request is even parsed.
//
// So the throttle is enforced in the accept loop, where a throttled connection
// costs no thread, no parse and no arbiter round trip. It is HELD there briefly
// rather than dropped: measured, dropping was worse than useless, because an
// instant EOF let the client reconnect sooner and CPU barely moved. A delay
// before ANSWERING, the other obvious shape, would also have been worse: it
// holds a connection thread for its whole duration and does nothing about CPU.
//
// It is fed ONLY by requests the arbiter actually refused, so a peer doing
// ordinary work is never throttled no matter how busy it is. Root is exempt:
// every privileged PAM stack (greeter, sudo, polkit helper) runs as uid 0, and
// starving those is worse than any flood.
//
// HONEST LIMIT: an unprivileged uid that floods itself into the throttle also
// delays its OWN user-context authentications, the KDE lock screen being the
// one that runs as the user rather than root. The window is deliberately short
// so this self-heals in well under a second, and the password remains the
// fallback throughout. A different uid can never cause it.
