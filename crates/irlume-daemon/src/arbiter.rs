//! Who gets the camera next.
//!
//! The daemon serves requests from one worker that owns the [`Engine`], because
//! two threads driving V4L2 and ONNX over one device is not something to attempt
//! on an authentication path. That single worker is also the problem: before
//! this module, a local account running a legitimate self-enrollment held it for
//! as long as the enrollment took, and a lock-screen unlock arriving meanwhile
//! waited in the kernel accept backlog where the daemon could not even see it.
//!
//! So connections are now read and parsed off the worker, and what they parse
//! into is queued here. Two rules do the work:
//!
//! * **Authentication goes first.** A queued or running authentication is what
//!   makes every other camera request wait.
//! * **Non-authentication camera work is refused, not queued,** while
//!   authentication is pending, and each unprivileged uid may hold at most one
//!   camera slot. Refusing beats queueing: a preview client that is told to come
//!   back has lost a frame, while one that is queued behind an enrollment holds
//!   a slot the login path may want.
//!
//! What this deliberately does not do is preempt by force. An operation already
//! running is ASKED to stop, through [`CancelToken`], and it answers at its own
//! next safe boundary: between whole captures, where nothing is half-written.
//! Nothing here unwinds a thread, closes a device out from under a capture, or
//! interrupts an ONNX session.
