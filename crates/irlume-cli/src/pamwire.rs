//! FAIL-SAFE: every face line is `[success=1 default=ignore]` or `sufficient`,
//! so the password is always the floor; wiring cannot lock the user out.
//!
//! Two file strategies: real `/etc/pam.d` files (gdm-password/sddm/lightdm/sudo)
//! are backed up to `*.pre-irlume` and edited in place (restore = move the backup
//! back); vendor-only files (plasmalogin/kde-fingerprint, shipped in

//! marked (revert = delete the override).
