//! `irlume uninstall`: the safe teardown a package `remove` cannot do.
//!
//! Removing the distro package deletes the binary and `pam_irlume.so`, but the
//! package manager does not know about the pam.d edits that reference them. A
//! `pam_irlume.so` line left behind after the module is gone makes PAM fail to
//! load it, which can lock you out of login and sudo. So the irlume-specific
//! teardown has to run FIRST, and in this order:
//!
//!   1. un-wire PAM from every stack (greeters, sudo, lock screen)
//!   2. stop and disable the daemon
//!   3. disarm every enrolled user's TPM keyring seal
//!   4. wipe enrolled templates, sealed secrets, third-party models, and config
//!
//! Only then does it remove irlume itself: the package through its manager (so
//! the package database stays consistent), or the hand-placed files for a
//! source install. It deletes the binary running this command last of all,
//! which is fine on Linux (the inode survives until the process exits). The
//! same teardown-then-remove backs the TUI's uninstall entry, which puts its
//! own double-confirmation in front of it and exits once it returns.
