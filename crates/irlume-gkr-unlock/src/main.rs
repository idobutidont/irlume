//! Unlock a user's GNOME login keyring with their sealed keyring token (#250).
//!
//! On a token-armed account the login keyring is keyed to a random token, not
//! the login password, so after a face or fingerprint login (and after a typed
//! password login, whose password no longer opens it) something must hand the
//! token to `gnome-keyring-daemon`. That channel is the daemon's control
//! socket, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/keyring/control`, with the `UNLOCK` operation:
//! the exact channel and operation `pam_gnome_keyring` itself uses.
//!
//! This exists as a separate program for the same reason `irlume-kwallet-init`
//! does: `pam_irlume` is loaded into sshd, login and every greeter, and it has
//! no privilege dropping. The control socket authenticates the peer's uid
//! (`gkr-pam-client.c` does its own seteuid dance for the same reason), so the
//! connection must be made AS the target user, and becoming the user
//! permanently in a short-lived helper keeps the module's blast radius
//! unchanged.
//!
//! Invoked as `irlume-gkr-unlock <username>` with the token on **stdin**,
//! never in argv, which is world-readable through `/proc`. Exit status 0 means
//! the daemon reported the keyring unlocked; anything else is a refusal or an
//! error, printed to stderr.
