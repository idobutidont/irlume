# Models

irlume bundles a **permissive, GPLv3-compatible** model stack. The weights are
hosted as release assets on the version-independent `models-v1` release (kept
OUT of Git LFS so builds do not consume the account's LFS bandwidth quota) and
loaded from `/usr/share/irlume/models/` (packages) or this dir (dev). After a
clone, fetch and sha256-verify them with `bash ../scripts/fetch-models.sh`; a
distro package bundles them, so an installed system needs no download.

`SHA256SUMS` holds the release checksums; the daemon embeds it at build time
and warns at startup when a loaded model doesn't match (see ../SECURITY.md).
The same hashes are pinned in `scripts/fetch-models.sh`, the Fedora spec, the
Arch PKGBUILD, and `flake.nix`. To change a shipped model: upload the new file
to a fresh `models-vN` release, regenerate `SHA256SUMS`
(`cd models && sha256sum *.onnx *.tflite > SHA256SUMS`), and update the hash in
all four places above plus the `models-vN` reference.

The `*.tflite` half of that glob is not decoration. `face_landmarks_detector.tflite`
is the one weight COMMITTED to git rather than fetched, so it is the only model
present in a tree that has not run `fetch-models.sh`. Two things depend on its
digest being in `SHA256SUMS`: the daemon verifies the mesh at startup, and
`strict_verify_refuses_a_tampered_model_and_accepts_a_shipped_one` uses it as
the fixture proving `IRLUME_MODELS_STRICT=1` still ACCEPTS a manifest-matching
model. Regenerating with `*.onnx` alone drops the line and breaks both.

| File | Stage | Source | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx` | detection | [OpenCV Zoo](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo) | **MIT** | bbox + 5 landmarks; int8 variant also fine |
| `glintr100.onnx` | recognition | [fal/AuraFace-v1](https://huggingface.co/fal/AuraFace-v1) | **Apache-2.0** | 512-D ArcFace; use ONLY this file from the repo |
| `flir.onnx` | IR PAD (default-on) | [Alibaba DAMO ModelScope `cv_manual_face-liveness_flir`](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/cv_manual_face-liveness_flir) (upstream artifact, re-hosted on the models-v1 release) | **MIT** | IR anti-spoof classifier, deny-only at 0.9, lit-phase frames (ADR-0013). Measured: 122/123 banner frames flagged on 2 cameras, revalidated at 197 identities on CBSR 850nm (0/3,940 above the wired threshold); genuine-side failure regimes mapped (dim strobe phase, direct sun). Training data undocumented by the publisher — same ADR-0013 basis as the ViT. |

Every file above is MIT or Apache-2.0. The liveness model's weights are
MIT-licensed but their training data is undocumented by the publisher; they
ship default-on as a DENY-ONLY cue under the ADR-0013 amendment (worst case is a
password fallback, harm bounded), which is a deliberately different bar than
the grant-capable recognition/detection models above.

### ir_adapter.onnx: removed (2026-07-15)

A former `ir_adapter.onnx` (a 512→512 residual MLP over IR embeddings) was
**retired and removed from the repo and every package** on 2026-07-15. Both
versions that ever shipped were trained on AuraFace embeddings of two academic
NIR datasets, CBSR NIR (OTCBVS benchmark dataset 07) and Oulu-CASIA NIR, whose
grants cover education and research only. By the same standard this project
applies to third-party weights (see the Silent-Face note below), that
restricted the adapter to non-commercial research use, which conflicts with the
commercial freedom GPLv3 promises downstream.

Its replacement is per-enrollment on-device calibration fitted from each user's
own scans (`../crates/irlume-core/src/calib.rs`), which carries no third-party
data. See [ADR-0004](../docs/adr/0004-per-enrollment-ir-adapter.md) for the
decision and the measurement: the global adapter improved recognition for the
handful of identities it was trained on but slightly *worsened* every unseen
face (Tufts NIR-NIR 1.43% → 1.53% EER), so raw AuraFace plus per-enrollment
calibration is the better default as well as the clean one. Existing
enrollments made against the old adapter are tagged with its embedding space
and must be re-enrolled after upgrading; the daemon refuses a space mismatch
rather than matching across it.

### MediaPipe FaceMesh: license-verified (unlike Silent-Face)

Cleared the clean-BOM gate 2026-07-01 against Google's **official model card**
(`storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-assets/…FaceMesh…`). Unlike Silent-Face, the
model card **itself states "LICENSED UNDER Apache License, Version 2.0"** (weights,
not just code; authored by Google) and documents **first-party training data**
(Google-collected smartphone/AR images, no MS-Celeb-1M / CelebA-Spoof taint). →
warrantable, GPLv3-compatible. **Currently shipped (2026-07-15):** the
478-point/256px FaceLandmarker mesh, converted with `tf2onnx --opset 17` from
the Apache-2.0 `face_landmarks_detector.tflite` inside Google's
`face_landmarker.task` bundle (TF needs Python ≤3.12 via a `uv` venv; neither
box ships one by default). The loader reads the input side from the model and
accepts either landmark generation (468 or 478), so the legacy 192px/468pt
`face_landmark.tflite` still loads if swapped back in (banked as `.legacy-192`).
Historical note: the older `face_landmark_with_attention.tflite` (478 + iris)
would not convert cleanly (tf2onnx left a `TFL_Landmarks2TransformMatrix`
custom op onnxruntime rejected), which is why the 468-point model shipped
first; the `face_landmarker.task` mesh converts without that op. Non-license
caveats to document at use: the card's out-of-scope notes ("not for
facial recognition/identification", "not for life-critical decisions") are
**advisory**: irlume uses it for dense landmarks and rescue-path alignment,
never recognition or head consent, with a mandatory password fallback; and it
is RGB/selfie-trained, so rescue behavior on IR-grey frames must be validated.

## Do NOT use

- **AuraFace's bundled `scrfd_10g_bnkps.onnx`** (and `1k3d68`, `2d106det`,
  `genderage`): those are InsightFace detection/aux models with **non-commercial**
  weights. Take only `glintr100.onnx` from that repo; use YuNet for detection.
- **InsightFace buffalo_l / antelopev2** (`w600k_r50`, `det_10g`): non-commercial
  weights, **incompatible with GPL** (which guarantees downstream commercial use).
- **Silent-Face / MiniFASNet anti-spoofing weights** (minivision-ai, incl. HF ONNX
  re-exports): the *code* is Apache-2.0 but the **weights carry no explicit license
  and no documented training data** (verified 2026-06-30; the re-export disclaims
  training and gives no warranty). Weights ≠ code: an Apache `LICENSE` on the source
  does not license weights whose provenance is unwarrantable. **Fails the clean-BOM
  bar**; do not bundle. Built-in anti-spoofing stays algorithmic IR physics;
  head consent is a separate intent gate
  ([ADR-0009](../docs/adr/0009-head-gesture-only-consent.md)) until a
  clean-licensed PAD model or own-IR-rig data exists.

## Verification

Record SHA-256 sums in `SHA256SUMS` and check them in CI before bundling.

## Open due-diligence item

fal's model card + blog state AuraFace was trained on a commercial dataset and
is for commercial use; the lower-than-ArcFace accuracy confirms independent
training (not a re-upload of antelopev2). For belt-and-braces, an issue asking
fal to confirm `glintr100.onnx`'s provenance in writing is worthwhile.
