# Machine API

`irlume` exposes a deliberately small, versioned JSON interface for desktop
integrations. Human-facing output remains the default.

## Compatibility

Every document contains:

```json
{
  "contract_version": 1,
  "engine_version": "0.7.0",
  "command": "version",
  "ok": true,
  "data": {}
}
```

Machine-mode standard output contains exactly one JSON document. Diagnostics
go to standard error.

**Streaming capabilities are the exception, and only ever by invitation.** A
capability whose name ends in `-events` emits newline-delimited JSON: one event
per line, many lines. A consumer reaches one only by invoking a command it found
in `capabilities`, so a consumer that does not implement streaming never sees
more than one document. The rule above is what every non-streaming command
follows, and it is what a contract 1 consumer built before streaming existed
will continue to observe. A successful command exits with zero. Usage errors exit
with 2, while unavailable or failed operations exit nonzero and return:

```json
{
  "contract_version": 1,
  "engine_version": "0.7.0",
  "command": "profiles.list",
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "daemon-unavailable",
    "retryable": true
  }
}
```

Fields may be added within a contract version. Removing a field or changing its
meaning requires a new contract version. Consumers must first call
`irlume version --json` and use only advertised capabilities.

The machine API is not the daemon socket protocol. The socket remains private,
and its serialized Rust enums are not a public compatibility promise.

### Declaring which contract you implement

Pass `--contract N` on any machine command. The engine agrees only to a version
it implements, and refuses anything else **before** contacting the daemon and
before any command with side effects begins:

```
$ irlume profiles list --contract 9 --json
{"contract_version":1,...,"error":{"code":"unsupported-contract","retryable":false}}
```

Exit code 2. A malformed flag (no value, a non-number, repeated) is a
`usage-error`.

`irlume version --json` advertises the range this build speaks:

```json
"contract_versions": { "min": 1, "max": 1 }
```

Pick a version inside that range and pass it. Every response echoes the contract
actually in force in `contract_version`, so a consumer can assert the engine
agreed to the version it implements rather than inferring it.

**Omitting the flag always means contract 1.** It does not mean "whatever is
newest", and it never will. A program written against contract 1 that omits the
flag keeps receiving contract 1 on an engine that has since learned contract 2,
because the alternative is changing the meaning of a response under a program
that never asked for it. Passing the flag is still better: it makes the refusal
explicit and immediate when a consumer meets an engine too old for it.

### A capability is not a compatibility promise

`capabilities` says a command exists and is reachable. It does not say the
engine's version is one a consumer has been tested against, and it is not a
substitute for `contract_version`. Gate on the contract version you implement;
treat a capability as an availability check on top of that.

Read this the way irlume writes it: a name in that list is permanent public API.
Once a name ships, consumers in the field may enable behaviour on seeing it, and
irlume cannot know which versions those are. So a name is never reused for
different semantics, and never appears before the command behind it is finished.

### Authorization

Every operation is authorized by the daemon from the connecting process's
credentials, not from anything the caller says about itself. An operation is
permitted for `root`, or for the user that owns the records being touched.
`--user` names which account to act on; it does not grant anything. An ordinary
user naming another account is refused.

Consumers should not attempt to pre-check permission. Call the command and read
the error.

### Timeouts and cancellation

Commands that only read state return promptly. Commands that use the camera take
as long as a capture takes, and irlume applies its own internal bounds. A
consumer should set its own timeout, and should treat terminating the process as
the cancellation mechanism for this contract version. There is no cancel
command in contract version 1.

### Deprecation

Within a contract version, no command or documented field is removed and no
documented meaning changes. If a command must change incompatibly, the new shape
arrives under a new `contract_version` and the previous one keeps working for at
least one minor release series, so a consumer has a window in which both are
available. Capability names are not removed once published; a capability that
becomes unavailable on a given machine simply stops being listed by that
machine.

## Commands

### `irlume version --json`

Does not contact the daemon. It returns the engine version, contract version,
advertised capabilities, and public limits.

### `irlume status --json [--user USER]`

Capability: `status-json`.

The readiness summary, as values rather than prose. Deliberately narrower than
the human `status`: it reports camera **capability** and never camera identity,
and it does not name the account, because the caller already knows which one it
asked about.

```json
{
  "daemon": "running",
  "auth_method": "auto",
  "face_disabled": false,
  "enrollment": { "known": true, "profiles": 1, "scans": 10 },
  "templates": "encrypted",
  "keyring": { "known": true, "armed": true, "policy": "…" },
  "recovery": { "known": true, "passphrase_set": true, "key_present": true },
  "camera": { "known": true, "rgb": true, "ir": true },
  "fingerprint": false,
  "fingerprint_known": true
}
```

`daemon` is one of `running`, `starting`, `access-denied` or `unreachable`.
`starting` means the socket answered but the engine is still loading models,
which lasts a few seconds after every daemon (re)start; retry shortly rather
than restarting. An unreachable daemon is reported, not raised as an error,
because the fields that do not need it are still worth having.

Anything derived from the daemon carries `known`. **Unknown is not zero**: when
`known` is false the counts are absent entirely rather than reported as `0`, so a
consumer cannot mistake "we could not find out" for "this account has nothing
enrolled".

Status observations share a two-second deadline. A starting or unreachable
daemon receives no follow-up queries; a slow response leaves remaining fields
unknown. This bounds daemon/helper waiting, not arbitrary filesystem or process
scheduling delays. Keyring status reads sealed-envelope metadata without reading
live PCRs. On an older daemon it falls back to the armed bit with a null policy.
Use explicit keyring diagnostics when checking PCR drift.

`camera.known` says a daemon Health observation was obtained. Without one, the
RGB/IR booleans use configured-path existence only, and status never opens camera
nodes. `fingerprint_known` says the bounded tooling/reader probe completed; when
false, the retained `fingerprint: false` boolean is an unobserved fallback rather
than confirmed absence. These added fields are optional for older contract-1
producers; consumers should not infer an observation when they are absent.

`templates` is `encrypted`, `plaintext`, or `unknown`.

`recovery.key_present` is whether a sealed template key currently exists. It is
a separate field rather than a third value of `templates` because contract 1
permits added fields and not new enum values, and because the two facts are
independent: `templates: "encrypted"` with `key_present: false` means the
templates cannot currently be opened, which no single value can say. When
`passphrase_set` is true, `irlume recovery restore` can recreate the sealed key
from the recovery envelope; when it is false, re-enrollment is the only path. A daemon older than 0.9.0 never sends it and it reads as
`true`, which is the only safe default for a field whose false value means data
loss.

### `irlume doctor --json`

Capability: `doctor-json`.

Every readiness check as an identified result:

```json
{ "checks": [
  { "id": "tpm", "state": "pass" },
  { "id": "platform", "state": "info", "detail": "Fedora-family" },
  { "id": "keyring-secrets", "state": "unknown" }
] }
```

`state` is one of `pass`, `warn`, `fail`, `unknown` or `info`. `unknown` is not a
synonym for `fail`: it means the check could not be carried out, usually because
the daemon was unreachable or the command ran without a session bus, and a
consumer should say so rather than report a problem the machine may not have.
`info` is a fact worth reporting that is neither good nor bad, such as the
platform family.

`detail` is English elaboration for a support report. It is not stable and not
for matching. A consumer that branches on that text has reintroduced the problem
this command removes.

**The array is complete.** Every check reports on every run, including checks
that do not apply to this machine, so a consumer may read an id it knows about
and cannot find as "this engine version does not run that check" rather than as
"it passed". A check never disappears because it had nothing to say.

`id` values are public API. The list may grow; an id is never renamed and never
reused for a different meaning. The registry as of this contract:

| Check id | Reports on |
|---|---|
| `platform` | the distribution family irlume detected |
| `install-origin` | where this build came from: a distro package, the Copr, or a source install |
| `tpm` | a usable TPM 2.0 resource-manager device |
| `secure-boot` | Secure Boot enabled, disabled, or in setup mode |
| `boot-mode` | the boot chain, which decides which PCR policy tier applies |
| `emitter-undo-pending` | camera controls an interrupted `ir-setup` left changed and has not put back. `unknown` when the root-only record store cannot be read, which is any run that is not root |
| `emitter-stream-pending` | per-stream emitter records not yet resolved. An `applied` record is restored by a later authentication; a record whose write may never have reached the camera is never claimed, and is replaced by the next capture once the control no longer holds its bytes (a full power-off does that); a record that will not parse blocks until an administrator removes the named file. Either kind also refuses new stream writes, so this explains an emitter that stays dark. `unknown` when the root-only store cannot be read, which is any run that is not root |
| `capture-mode` | the daemon-owned v2 resolution for its exact open RGB+IR pair. Reports qualified concurrent, measured sequential, the safe unmeasured/changed-context sequential default, a daemon environment override, or generation-scoped runtime degradation. `info` for a resolved strategy and `unknown` only when the daemon cannot collect exact status. Neither `doctor` nor `camera-mode` treats legacy `capture_mode.*` values in `cameras.conf` as concurrent authority |
| `signed-pcr-policy` | the systemd signed-PCR (Tier 1) policy for sealing |
| `pcrlock` | the systemd-pcrlock (Tier 2) policy and its NV index |
| `camera-nodes` | whether an RGB and an IR node were classified. Capability only; no device paths |
| `ir-stream-hello-minimum` | the negotiated IR stream compared with the published Windows Hello IR minimum (340x340@15fps). `info` when no IR node is selected or the dimensions meet it with no reported rate; `unknown` when the node cannot be negotiated right now |
| `rgb-stream-hello-minimum` | the negotiated RGB stream compared with the published Windows Hello RGB minimum (480x480@7.5fps). Same states as the IR check |
| `models` | the ONNX weights irlume needs, present and checksummed |
| `stage-detection-model` | the face-detection stage's model: the resolved file and whether it is shipped or an env override. `fail` when missing, because the daemon cannot start |
| `stage-recognition-model` | the recognizer stage's model. `fail` when missing, because the daemon cannot start |
| `ort-dylib-path` | the `ORT_DYLIB_PATH` override, when one is set |
| `onnxruntime` | the ONNX Runtime the resolver would load in this shell: the resolved path (or the system library) and its version. `fail` when that library is unloadable or below the API level irlume needs, because model loading cannot succeed against it (#187) |
| `fingerprint-reader` | whether a fingerprint reader was found |
| `templates` | face templates encrypted at rest for the account asked about |
| `recovery-passphrase` | whether a recovery passphrase is set |
| `credential-release-challenge` | reserved legacy check; always `info` after head-gesture removal |
| `polkit-app-prompts` | whether polkit application prompts accept a face match |
| `polkit-helper-sandbox` | whether the polkit helper's sandbox permits what irlume needs |
| `ir-calibration` | whether this account's IR enrollment carries the per-user liveness floor |
| `login-wiring` | whether face auth is wired into the login stack |
| `display-manager` | whether the active display manager is one irlume can target |
| `pam-regeneration-guard` | whether a distro PAM regeneration would strip the wiring unnoticed |
| `install-hygiene` | leftover backups, and hand-installed builds overlaying packaged ones |
| `keyring-secrets` | the login keyring's lock state and provider |

`CaptureModeStatus` includes `qualification_state` (`qualified_concurrent`,
`measured_sequential`, `unqualified_no_authority`,
`unqualified_context_changed`, `inconclusive`, `unreadable`, or `no_ir_pair`), an optional
`qualification_reason`, the complete serialized v2 `qualification_context`
(endpoint identity, requested and driver-accepted tuples, minimum rates, and
USB connection facts), and an optional `runtime_degradation` cause. `ir` is
nullable for an RGB-only host. `runtime_context` is the process-local exact
context+camera-generation key; it is diagnostic, not durable authority.

## Schema, fixtures, and conformance

Contract 1 has a JSON Schema (2020-12) at `schemas/machine-api-v1.schema.json`,
installed on packaged systems at
`/usr/share/irlume/schemas/machine-api-v1.schema.json`.

**The schema does not close its objects, and a consumer's validator must not
either.** Fields may be added within a contract version, so rejecting unknown
properties turns a permitted engine update into a broken consumer.

`schemas/fixtures/v1/` holds documents captured from a real engine, including the
daemon-unreachable and refusal cases, for building against without an
installation. `scripts/machine-api-conformance.py` checks a build the way a
consumer would: envelope rules, every advertised capability answering, and the
refusals behaving. [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md) is the guide for writing a
consumer.

### `irlume login status --json`

Capability: `login-status-json`.

Which PAM surfaces carry face auth, by service name:

```json
{
  "login_manager": {
    "known": true,
    "name": "plasmalogin",
    "recognized": true,
    "services": ["plasmalogin"]
  },
  "surfaces": [
    { "id": "plasmalogin", "role": "login-screen", "present": true, "wired": true, "mode": "on-demand" },
    { "id": "sddm", "role": "login-screen", "present": false, "wired": false },
    { "id": "kde", "role": "lock-screen", "present": true, "wired": true, "mode": "on-demand" },
    { "id": "sudo", "role": "sudo", "present": true, "wired": true, "mode": "verify" }
  ],
  "selinux_module": "loaded"
}
```

`id` is the PAM service name, and it is public API on the same terms as a doctor
check id: the list may grow, an id is never renamed and never reused. Paths under
`/etc/pam.d` are not published, for the reason `status --json` publishes camera
capability and not camera nodes.

`role` is one of `login-screen`, `login-screen-fingerprint`, `lock-screen`,
`sudo` or `polkit`.

`present` is whether the service exists on this machine at all, counting a vendor
copy an override would be materialized from. `wired` is whether it currently
carries the irlume line.

**The surface array is complete.** A service absent from the machine is still
reported, with `present: false`, so a consumer that knows an id and cannot find
it may read that as "this engine version does not wire that service" rather than
as "it is not wired here".

`mode` says how face fires on a wired surface: `face-first` (the camera verifies
as soon as the greeter prompts), `on-demand` (the user submits an empty password
to trigger face), `keyring` (the fingerprint keyring-unlock line, which is not a
face factor), or `verify` (the plain sudo and polkit stanza). It is absent, never
null, when the surface is not wired.

`login_manager.known` is false when no `display-manager.service` is set: a
headless host, or a greeter that registers none. That is not the same as "no
login manager is installed", and a consumer should not render it that way.
`recognized` is whether irlume can wire face login for this login manager. It is
false both for one irlume has no mapping for and for one whose mapped PAM service
irlume has no wiring recipe for; either way `login enable` cannot target it, which
is what a consumer needs to know. `services` are the PAM
services that login manager consults, which is how a consumer decides which
surface entry describes its own login screen without matching on names. A service
listed there with no matching entry in `surfaces` is one this engine has no
wiring recipe for.

`selinux_module` is `loaded`, `not-loaded` or `unknown`. Reading the policy store
needs root, so an ordinary caller gets `unknown`, which is not a synonym for
`not-loaded`.

Privileged face confirmation is fixed service policy, not mutable machine
state. PAM and the daemon enforce it from the shared normalized service table;
CLI/TUI render the same rule. Contract 1 therefore adds no confirmation or
attestation field. Head gestures have been removed. See
[ADR-0010](adr/0010-conventional-face-intent-confirmation.md).

### `irlume profiles list --json [--user USER]`

Capability: `profiles-list-json`.

Returns display names and scan display names. `require_eyes_open` and
`require_challenge` are required contract-1 compatibility fields, both frozen
at `false`; they do not report enrollment policy or a current detector. They may
leave with contract 2. See [ADR-0009](adr/0009-head-gesture-only-consent.md).
The current enrollment store identifies these records by mutable names,
so this first read-only contract intentionally does not invent opaque IDs or
advertise profile mutations. Mutation-safe IDs must originate in the engine
store before a later capability can expose them.

Display names are chosen by the user, so treat them as user text rather than
identifiers: they may contain anything the user typed.

Each profile also carries `recognizers`: how many of its scans belong to each
recognizer, and which recognizer the daemon has loaded. A profile can hold
templates from several recognizers at once, since a scan records the model
that produced it, and only the loaded recognizer's templates can match. The
flat `scans` list therefore cannot answer whether a profile is usable right
now; the entry whose `live` is true can. None is live when the loaded
recognizer has no templates in that profile, which is what an operator sees
after switching models before re-adding scans.

`recognizers` is ABSENT, not empty, when the daemon did not report the counts.
That happens against a daemon older than 0.9.0, which is what a consumer sees
between the package upgrade and the daemon restart. An empty array would mean
"no recognizer has templates here", so emitting it beside a populated `scans`
list would be the unknown-as-zero mistake. Treat a missing `recognizers` as
unknown and fall back to `scans`; do not treat it as a profile that needs
re-enrolling.

Profiles may also carry `ir`, reported by the daemon for its loaded
recognizer and IR pipeline. Its `compatible_scans`, `missing_scans`,
`unknown_scans`, and `incompatible_scans` partition that recognizer's scans.
Missing means no IR template; unknown means no recorded IR pipeline tag;
incompatible means a different pipeline tag or embedding dimension. Scans
for other recognizers remain in the existing `recognizers` breakdown.

`calibration_withheld` reports a stored raw-IR calibration that cannot be used
while unknown IR scans for this recognizer remain in the profile. Compatible
IR scans can still match without calibration. Adding fresh scans alone does
not clear this restriction while the unknown scans remain.

An absent `ir` means the daemon did not report compatibility; do not treat it
as zero scans or prescribe re-enrollment. These are template counts, not a
camera/liveness check or a guarantee that dark authentication will succeed.
The field is additive within contract 1; older consumers ignore it.

### `irlume models list --json`

Capability: `models-list-json`.

The pipeline stages in order, each with its model **candidate**: the file this
CLI process's search order lands on, its origin (`shipped`, `caller-env` when
the calling process's environment chose the path, or `built-in` for the PAD
stage's gate, which is code rather than a swappable file), and whether it
opened as a regular file (`readable`). It is a candidate and not a claim about
the daemon, because the daemon's service unit (or an administrator's drop-in)
sets the daemon's own environment, which a shell invocation cannot observe. On
a stock install the candidate coincides with what the daemon loads; an
authoritative loaded-model report can only ever come from the daemon itself.
`observed: true` with `readable: false` (a directory at the path, an
unreadable file) means the daemon's load of that same candidate would fail.

Each stage also reports whether the daemon requires the file to start, and
`open`, which is `false` on every stage since third-party model support was
removed (ADR-0015): irlume ships and supports exactly the models-v1 set. A
closed stage never carries a `third_party` object.

The command needs no daemon, so it still answers when the daemon will not
start.

### `irlume camera census --json`

Capability: `camera-census`.

Every video-adjacent device on the machine, classified once, each row
carrying the evidence its classification keyed on (#575). The command runs
CLI-side like `doctor --json` (read-only `/dev/video*` opens and sysfs
walks; no daemon), so unreadable nodes are their own class with the errno as
evidence rather than a failure.

```json
{
  "listing_error": null,
  "entries": [
    {
      "node": "/dev/video0",
      "class": "uvc_rgb",
      "paired": true,
      "verdict": "supported",
      "note": null,
      "privacy_engaged": false,
      "evidence": ["driver uvcvideo on USB", "USB 046d:085e", "internal", "formats MJPG/YUYV"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Row fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `node` | The `/dev/videoN` row, or `null` for machine-level rows (MIPI pipelines, unbound USB devices) |
| `class` | One of `uvc_rgb`, `uvc_ir`, `y8_ir`, `metadata_only`, `dummy_node`, `unreadable_node`, `mc_centric`, `mipi_ipu`, `mipi_vendor_bridge`, `usb_camera_without_driver`. Class-specific side fields (`paired`, `generation`, `usb_id`) sit beside it |
| `verdict` | `supported` (with a tier `note`), `supported_with_limits`, `informational`, `not_hardware`, `unsupported`, or `broken`. Every `note` names the supported path or the next step |
| `privacy_engaged` | The hardware privacy shutter is engaged on that node: nothing is wrong, the shutter needs opening. `null` on machine-level rows (no node to probe) or when the control could not be read |
| `evidence` | The facts the classification keyed on (driver, USB identity, format fourccs, internal/external, cause). Never empty |

`listing_error` is non-null when `/dev` could not be listed: the census may
be incomplete, which is not the same as empty.

### `irlume camera diagnostics --json`

Capability: `camera-diagnostics`.

Machine-readable delivered-rate evidence for the configured pair (#462), plus
the MS-XU illumination stream state (#568). Runs through the daemon: one
bounded, gated capture per present role. No device path, account identity, or
template data is exposed.

```json
{
  "rgb": { "known": true, "state": "measured", "evidence": { ... } },
  "ir": { "known": true, "state": "measured", "evidence": { ... } },
  "skew_us": 3612533,
  "capture_strategy": "burst",
  "illumination": { "node": "present", "frames_classified": 10, "frames_lit": 5, "ambient_observed": true }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rgb`, `ir` | Per-role diagnostic: `"measured"` (floor cleared), `"fail"` (under-rate), `"missing"` (no node), or `"unknown"` (open/transport failure) |
| `rgb.evidence` / `ir.evidence` | Exact requested/accepted/delivered rationals, floor, tolerance, window count/span, sequence gap, cumulative drops, timestamp clock and source, latest timestamp |
| `skew_us` | Same-domain RGB/IR skew in microseconds. `null` means unknown (the two latest timestamps do not share clock and source, or a role is missing) |
| `capture_strategy` | The strategy the diagnostic used (`"burst"`, `"streaming"`) |
| `illumination` | The MS-XU illumination metadata stream state (#568): `node` (`"present"`/`"absent"`), `frames_classified`, `frames_lit`, `ambient_observed`. `null` on an RGB-only pair (no IR node to probe). Reports written before #568 deserialize this as `null` |

The `illumination` section: `node` is whether the IR node's metadata sibling
accepted the UVCM probe; `frames_classified` is how many burst frames the
camera's own illumination metadata classified; `frames_lit` the subset it
flagged lit; `ambient_observed` is true only when the camera flagged both a
lit and a dark frame, meaning the counts reflect a real emitter-off
observation rather than absent records.

### Error codes

| Code | Meaning | `retryable` |
|---|---|---|
| `usage-error` | The command line was not one this contract accepts. Exits 2. | no |
| `unsupported-contract` | The engine does not implement the requested contract. Refused before any side effect. Exits 2. | no |
| `daemon-unavailable` | The daemon could not be reached. | yes |
| `not-authorized` | The caller may not act on the named account. | no |
| `operation-failed` | The engine could not carry out a well-formed request. | no |
| `camera-busy` | The camera driver reported contention. Close apps using the camera, then retry. Auth tests include a fixed human-readable `message`. | yes |
| `protocol-error` | The daemon replied with something this command did not expect. | no |

`not-authorized` and `operation-failed` are distinct so a consumer can tell "you
may not do that" from "something broke", and act accordingly: the first is worth
a message about permissions, the second is worth a retry or a support report.

`not-authorized` deliberately says nothing about whether the named account
exists. An ordinary caller is refused before the enrollment store is consulted,
so a real account and an invented one produce the identical answer, and this
command cannot be used to discover which accounts exist or which are enrolled.

`retryable` means an identical request could plausibly succeed later without the
caller changing the request. A camera conflict or another Irlume operation may
clear, so `camera-busy` and `session-busy` can also be retryable. It is not a
promise that a retry will succeed, and it carries no suggested delay.

### `irlume auth test --events=jsonl`

Capability: `auth-test-events`.

Camera-busy authentication errors are typed at the camera I/O boundary; text
containing "camera busy" is never treated as a code. The diagnostic client opts
in to structured daemon errors. An older daemon may still return
`operation-failed`; no automatic second capture is attempted. Older clients
retain legacy daemon replies. An identified Irlume-only holder fault remains a
generic hardware failure rather than advice to close another application.
The TUI's authentication test uses the same request and renders actionable
camera-busy guidance rather than raw JSON. `retryable` does not trigger an
automatic retry: the camera must become available first.

Does the claimed account's live face match its own enrolment? This is
verification against one account, never identification, and it releases nothing:
the answer is a verdict. It cannot alter a profile, a threshold, or a credential,
because it issues no request that could.

Output is newline-delimited JSON, one event per line:

```
{"contract_version":1,"engine_version":"0.7.1","command":"auth.test","operation_id":"8db4...","session_id":"a14a...","sequence":0,"event":"started","terminal":false,"data":{"operation":"auth-test"}}
{"contract_version":1,...,"sequence":1,"event":"capturing","terminal":false,"data":{}}
{"contract_version":1,...,"sequence":2,"event":"result","terminal":true,"data":{"granted":false,"live":true,"reason":"no-match"}}
```

Every line carries the whole envelope rather than relying on a header sent once,
so a line remains meaningful on its own in a log or after a dropped read.

Three properties a consumer may rely on:

- `sequence` starts at zero and increments by one with no gaps, so a lost line
  is detected by arithmetic rather than by timeout;
- exactly one event has `terminal` true, and it is the last, so a reader knows
  when to stop without waiting. **A stream that ends without one means the
  producer died**: it was killed, lost power, or hit a signal it could not
  handle. Treat end-of-file as terminal as well, because a reader that waits for
  the flag alone will wait forever. Verified: killing the command mid-stream
  leaves the lines already emitted and no terminal event, which is the only
  honest thing a dead process can do;
- `operation_id` is identical on every line of one invocation.

`reason` is one of `granted`, `not-live`, or `no-match`, derived from `granted`
and `live`. It is never derived from daemon wording, so a reworded message is not
a breaking change.

`reason` cannot express a refusal that never looked at a face. The configured
method being fingerprint, the RGB-only convenience tier, the opt-in biopolicy
gate and the rate limiter all answer `granted: false, live: false`, and `reason`
reports every one of them as `not-live`: a face looked fake when none was
examined. `refusal` carries that distinction and is absent when granted:

| `refusal` | what happened |
| --- | --- |
| `policy` | refused before any capture: the configured method, the tier, the biopolicy gate, or the rate limiter |
| `declined` | legacy daemon cancellation; current daemons do not emit this value |
| `no-match` | a live face that did not match the enrolment |
| `not-live` | the liveness gate refused the capture |

`reason` keeps its three values and its meaning, so a consumer written before
`refusal` existed reads exactly what it read before.

**The match score is not reported.** A caller that can read a continuous score
can hill-climb against it, adjusting a presentation until it crosses the
threshold, which would turn a diagnostic into an oracle. `granted` and `live`
are the facts a settings panel needs.

The account is not echoed back, for the same reason ordinary machine output
carries no usernames: the caller already knows which account it asked about, and
a desktop may log the stream.

An exit status of zero means the test ran. It does not mean the face matched;
read `granted` for that. A refusal before the stream begins is reported as a
single document with the usual error codes and exit 2, not as a stream. A
failure once the stream has started is a terminal `error` event and exit 1.

Naming an account the caller may not act on is one such failure, and it reports
`operation-failed` rather than `not-authorized`. That flattening is deliberate:
distinguishing the two would answer "does this account exist and is it enrolled"
for any local process, and the engine already refuses to let one account's face
be tested against another's enrolment for the same reason.

One session per user runs at a time. A second concurrent invocation is refused
with `session-busy`, which is retryable. A lock that cannot be taken at all,
because the runtime directory is unwritable, is `operation-failed` and is not
retryable: the two mean opposite things to a caller, and reporting both as busy
would tell a consumer to keep trying against a permission error. The lock is held by the running process
and released by the kernel when it exits, so a panel that is killed mid-capture
does not strand the user.

`--preview` is refused. Preview frames are a separate capability that this
build does not advertise; accepting the flag and ignoring it would suggest that
frames were withheld by policy rather than never implemented.

Stream lines validate against `$defs/event` in the schema, not against the
document root. `schemas/fixtures/v1/auth-test-events.ndjson` is a capture from a
real engine.

### `irlume login plan --action {enable|disable} --json`

Capability: `login-plan-json`.

The plan phase of a login transaction: what `login enable` or `login disable`
would change, without changing anything.

```json
{
  "plan_id": "c574f96dba23c06bbb2e2f395a74f074",
  "action": "disable",
  "changes": [
    { "surface": "gdm-password", "role": "login-screen", "change": "not-installed", "writes": false },
    { "surface": "plasmalogin", "role": "login-screen", "change": "restore-backup", "writes": true },
    { "surface": "kde", "role": "lock-screen", "change": "restore-backup", "writes": true },
    { "surface": "sudo", "role": "sudo", "change": "restore-backup", "writes": true },
    { "surface": "polkit-1", "role": "polkit", "change": "remove-override", "writes": true }
  ],
  "writes": 4,
  "requires_root": true
}
```

Absent surfaces are trimmed from this example for length; a real document lists
every one. The top-level `writes` always equals the number of entries whose own
`writes` is true.

This runs the identical decision the apply path runs, with writing switched off,
so a plan cannot describe an outcome the apply would not produce. Reading the PAM
stack needs no privilege; `requires_root` says whether applying would.

Every surface irlume can wire appears, including absent ones, so a consumer
reading an id it knows and cannot find learns "this engine does not wire that
service" rather than "not wired here". Surfaces are named by PAM service, never
by path, in keeping with the no-paths rule.

`change` is one of `wire`, `materialize-override`, `restore-backup`,
`remove-override`, `strip-in-place`, `already-correct`, `not-installed`,
`no-anchor`, `not-wired`. `writes` on a change says whether applying it would
touch disk, and the top-level `writes` counts them, so "nothing to do" is a fact
the engine states rather than one a consumer infers from outcome names it may
not recognise.

`plan_id` is a digest of the action and the exact per-surface outcomes it was
computed against. Two plans over an unchanged machine share an id; any change to
what would happen produces a different one. It exists so that a later apply can
refuse a plan that no longer matches the machine rather than silently doing
something the consumer never displayed. It is an identifier, not a security
boundary: apply will re-derive the plan from the machine rather than trusting
anything the id encodes.

Sudo and polkit are opt-in on the human command and are not included in a plan,
so a panel never shows a user surfaces they did not ask for. Disabling still
covers every surface, because turning login off leaves nothing behind.

A plan is carried out by `login apply` below, which re-derives it and refuses a
`plan_id` that no longer matches.

### `irlume login apply` / `verify` / `rollback`

Capability: `login-transactions`. The mutating half of a login transaction;
`login plan` above is the read-only half.

```
irlume login apply    --action {enable|disable} --plan-id ID --json   # root
irlume login verify   --transaction-id ID --json
irlume login rollback --transaction-id ID [--apply] --json            # root to apply
```

**apply** re-derives the plan from the machine and recomputes its id. A
`plan_id` that no longer matches is refused as `plan-stale`: the consumer
displayed one set of changes and the machine now calls for another, so applying
would change something nobody was shown. The supplied id is never trusted as
input, only compared. On success it returns a `transaction_id`.

A partial apply is reported as a failure and still records its transaction, so
the surfaces that did change can be rolled back. The id travels IN THE
DOCUMENT in that case, as a top-level `transaction_id` beside `failed`, not on
standard error: machine mode promises stdout carries the answer and stderr
stays empty, and a caller recovering from a half-changed login stack needs the
id from the same place it reads everything else.

**verify** answers whether the machine is still as that transaction left it,
per surface: `as-applied`, `changed-since-apply`, or `unreadable`. It also
states `rollback_available`, so a consumer does not have to infer it from
per-surface states it may not recognise. Read-only.

**rollback** restores what the transaction changed, and **refuses unless every
surface is still exactly as apply left it**. Restoring a file something else has
edited since would revert a change the transaction never made, so drift stops
the whole rollback rather than skipping the drifted surface: a half-rolled-back
login stack is its own hazard. Every surface is checked before any is written.
Without `--apply` it reports what it would restore and touches nothing.

Transaction records live under the state directory, `0600` in a `0700`
directory. They contain the pre-change content of each file, which is not secret
(PAM stacks are world-readable) but does describe exactly how a machine
authenticates.

A transaction id is a 32-character hex string. Anything else is a `usage-error`,
rejected rather than sanitised, because the id becomes a filename.

Error codes: `plan-stale`, `changed-since-apply`, `not-found`,
`not-authorized` (apply and `rollback --apply` need root, checked before
anything is written rather than left to a write failing partway),
`unconfirmed-transaction`, `unsupported-record`, `unmanaged-path` (a record
names a file irlume does not manage, so rollback refuses to touch it),
`operation-failed`.

A surface's `.pre-irlume` backup is part of the surface. The plan id covers it,
so a backup that changes between `plan` and `apply` makes the plan stale: wiring
rebuilds from the backup when one exists, so the content an apply produces
depends on it, and a consumer would otherwise be shown one outcome while the
machine got another. Rollback checks it too and refuses the whole record if it
is not as apply left it. That matters more than it sounds: a later `login
enable` rebuilds the live stack FROM the backup, so a wrong one reaches PAM at
the next enable rather than sitting inert.

A rollback that stops partway records which surfaces it put back, durably, as it
goes. Re-running it resumes: those surfaces are skipped rather than re-checked,
because a restored file deliberately no longer matches the digest apply left and
checking it would refuse the whole record, which used to leave the operator
rebuilding the rest from the JSON by hand. `verify` reports them as
`already_restored` and excludes them from `rollback_available`, so drift caused
by irlume's own restore is not reported as somebody's edit.

`rollback --accept-unconfirmed --apply` copies every surface and sidecar as it
currently stands into a root-only directory before restoring anything, and
returns that path as `snapshot`. An unconfirmed record has no trustworthy
after-digest, so the restore does not check what it overwrites; that is how an
interrupted apply is recovered, and equally how a package update made after the
crash gets reverted. The copies are for a person to find, and feed no automatic
path. A confirmed rollback has no `snapshot`: its drift check has already
established every file is byte-for-byte what apply left.

`unsupported-record` means the record was written to a record schema this engine
does not implement, and it is not retryable: run the newer irlume. A record
carries a `schema_version`, which is a gate rather than a description. It is
raised only when the MEANING of a record changes, so a purely descriptive
addition does not raise it and an older engine keeps reading such records. What
an engine will not do is act on the parts of a newer record it recognises: the
fields would parse and look reasonable while meaning something else, and a
record is the recovery path for a machine's login stack.

Every irlume path that changes PAM (`login apply`, `login rollback --apply`,
the human `login enable`/`disable`, and the self-heal reconcile) holds one
exclusive lock for the whole operation, so a consumer's transaction cannot
interleave with another irlume process. The lock does not cover package managers
or an administrator with an editor, which is why each surface is re-checked
immediately before it is written.

irlume refuses to write a PAM path that is a symlink or that has more than one
hard link, on every one of those paths. Renaming over a symlink would silently
convert it to a regular file, and replacing a multiply-linked file would leave
the other names on the old content; neither is recorded, so neither could be
undone. Such a surface is reported as not installed with the reason.

## Security and privacy

Ordinary JSON output never includes camera frames, embeddings, templates,
passwords, credential material, TPM secrets, device paths, or usernames.
Errors contain stable codes instead of daemon prose.

The following are not part of contract version 1 yet and must not be inferred
from human output or the private socket protocol:

- enrollment event streams;
- preview images and cancellation semantics;
- profile or scan mutation;
- camera configuration mutation;
- enrollment preview images and their cancellation semantics.
