## NixOS module for irlume: the daemon, camera access, and the PAM wiring.
##
##   services.irlume = {
##     enable = true;
##     pam.services.sddm = {};   # graphical login  -> face unlocks the wallet
##     pam.services.kde   = {};  # Plasma lock screen -> face unlocks it
##   };
##
## The PAM control flags below are not guesses; each was derived on a live VM
## against the actual greeter/lock stacks (docs/NIXOS.md records the matrix).
## The short version:
##
##   * A login greeter (sddm, gdm-password, greetd, ly, tty login) gets
##     `[success=1 default=ignore]`, NOT `sufficient`. It records the face
##     success but skips exactly one rule, so pam_kwallet / pam_gnome_keyring
##     still runs and unseals the wallet, and pam_unix grants on the token the
##     daemon unsealed. `sufficient` would short-circuit past the keyring and
##     leave the session with a locked wallet.
##
##   * A lock screen (kde, swaylock, hyprlock) gets `sufficient`. The wallet is
##     already open in the live session, so there is no keyring handoff to make;
##     and pam_unix on a verify-only unlock cannot grant, so a `success=1` jump
##     would fall through to pam_deny. `sufficient` grants the unlock outright.
##
##   * A text-mode greeter (greetd, ly) is not seen as a graphical session, so
##     pam_kwallet skips itself unless told otherwise. When such a service opts
##     in, this module sets its kwallet `forceRun = true` so the wallet still
##     unseals from the login token.
##
## The keyring backend itself (KWallet on Plasma, gnome-keyring on GNOME/wlroots)
## is whatever your desktop already enables; this module does not pick one. For
## greetd on a wlroots compositor there is one more piece, the keyring session
## wrapper, documented in docs/NIXOS.md and exposed here as
## `config.services.irlume.keyringSessionWrapper`.
