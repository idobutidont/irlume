# (verified 2026-07-16: f43 1.20.1, f44 1.22.2; rawhide's 1.26 is the first

%description
irlume authenticates you to Linux by your face with whatever camera the
machine has: an infrared (Windows Hello) camera enables the secure tier
(login, sudo, and TPM-sealed keyring unlock with algorithmic IR liveness)
while a regular RGB webcam enables convenient screen unlock, and a
fingerprint reader can join as a companion factor. A thin PAM module talks
to a privileged daemon that owns the camera and runs a clean-license model
stack. Privileged face authentication requests require typed confirmation by
default; the machine owner can explicitly waive it. Face authentication has a persistent retry
limit, while password login remains available. The TUI provides setup,
configuration, recovery controls, and current daemon observations.

%changelog
* Sat Aug 29 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.11.3-1
- AppArmor: emitter-journal ancestor-fsync reads and the qualification-store
  file lock are granted in both profiles (set-cameras persist, camera-tune and
  ir-setup work on enforcing hosts) (#573/#582/#590)
- Omarchy: fingerprint wiring honors upstream's contract; face unlock on the
  stock lock screen (#583/#584); Cinnamon lock screen face (#585)
- camera-tune reports the persisted verdict and names the continuity fact that
  failed (#588/#591/#592); TUI shows capture qualification state
- proactive concurrent degradation and background auto-requalification after a
  camera-context change (#594)
- security audit batch: atomic mode-preserving PAM edits, atomic method-file
  writes, sanitized journal service strings (#597); CodeQL noise fix (#595)
- forbid_external_cameras policy for high-security deployments (#577-era)
- docs: census/machine diagnostics grounding, far-range dark-path sweep,
  XFCE-lock unsupported note, calibration campaign foundations (#578/#579/#581/
  #593/#596)

* Tue Aug 25 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.11.2-1
- rpm-ostree: %post survives the scriptlet sandbox (touch instead of `: >`,
  guarded mkdir); layering was impossible on Silverblue/Kinoite before this
- docs: one page for turning irlume off (docs/DISABLE.md)

* Mon Aug 24 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.11.1-1
- IR emitter lock: shared with non-root camera tools under the sandboxed daemon (#542)
- IR emitter lock: setgid /run/lock/irlume via tmpfiles.d, group-strip hardening
- Emitter journal: an unexaminable store reports "could not check", not a phantom record

* Sun Aug 23 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.11.0-1
- SecureDark: scene gate + 0.635 dark threshold (ADR-0016)
- Capture-path: role-aware flush (-3.3s/auth), schedule-aware pairing (ADR-0014)
- IR emitter lock: clean installs keep IR auth under confinement
- AppArmor: template-key locks + media-controller reads
- TUI: Diagnostics fixes issues in-app; visible support report; exit chip
- install.sh: verified channel fallbacks for Copr/PPA outages
- uninstall: socket, units, AppArmor profile, user XDG state swept

* Wed Aug 12 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.10.0-1
- Per-service consent gestures with a head-shake decline; elevation and polkit prompts require a nod by default
- The keyring-release gesture default changed from ON to OFF; opt back in with irlume credential-release-challenge credential_release on
- The landmark mesh is now the published .tflite on a bundled TFLite runtime; a runtime that fails to load degrades to nod-only instead of stopping the daemon
- The polkit PAM stanza migrates to the abort=die control on upgrade so the shake decline works
- login enable refuses to act on an unestablished camera reading, closing a path that could unwire face auth from every greeter
- Camera fixes: session recovery keeps the emitter lit, scanning opens fewer nodes, capture verifies the negotiated format, backlight compensation is restored after sessions
- Repair and doctor report the TFLite runtime, a starting daemon, and per-service gesture state accurately
* Wed Aug 05 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.9.0-1
- A sandboxed run could delete live template keys and recovery envelopes, because those paths ignored IRLUME_STATE_DIR; all state paths now honor the override
- recovery setup accepted an empty passphrase when stdin was a pipe; the 12-character floor now applies to both paths
- The AppArmor profile blocked every Tier 2 TPM unseal by omitting /var/lib/systemd/pcrlock.json, so the keyring stopped opening at login
- The TUI and CLI reported "off"/"none" for state they could not read; an unanswered question now renders as unknown
- The TUI no longer opens camera nodes while the daemon streams them, which failed enrollment on strict UVC modules (#187)
- A profile can hold templates for more than one recognizer; profiles add-scan and profiles forget-model manage that state (#288)
- The recognition stage opens to measured third-party models, starting with buffalo_l (#276)
- Every catalog entry names its pipeline stage; detection and landmarks stay closed
- A native TFLite runtime ships at /usr/share/irlume/tflite/ behind a stage gate that stays closed
- Dark login was unreachable since 0.8.0 and works again (#284)
- Garbage landmark geometry abstains instead of scoring confident wrong numbers
- enroll --scans and camera-tune --rounds with a non-numeric value are usage errors, not a capture at the default count
- The CLI no longer opens video nodes while the daemon streams them, completing the #187 fix that #300 started in the TUI
- A scan budget an older daemon did not report reads as unknown rather than zero, which had silently under-enrolled during the upgrade window
- Packit could not build an SRPM at all since the TFLite runtime tag was published; .packit.yaml now filters to release tags
- CI validates the AppArmor profiles, which nothing checked before
* Tue Aug 04 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.8.1-1
- A printed photograph of an enrolled face passes the built-in liveness gate; the cue cannot be repaired by tuning it, and the mitigation is `irlume models enable flir` (advisory, #235)
- A blown infrared frame is refused rather than judged, so clipping no longer silences the PAD cue (#237)
- Burst selection prefers a lit frame that is not clipped, which is how ordinary captures reached that regime (#221)
- The sealed envelope no longer holds the login password: the KWallet key on KDE, a random re-keyed token on GNOME (#250)
- A fingerprint login after a reboot no longer meets a keyring prompt; systemd owns the socket and the per-boot sweep is gone (#244, #249)
- Keyring unseal latency drops from 10.88s to 2.71s on a discrete TPM; the policy digests are computed in software (#246, #248)
- A retryable TPM PCR-counter race no longer surfaces as a keyring prompt on a fast login
- irlume no longer names itself as the application holding its own camera, and enrolment stops opening one camera twice (#187)
- A status read can no longer make a login wait (#212)

* Sun Aug 02 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.8.0-1
- Emitter write honours the Windows exclusive-control model; consumer scan reports its blind spot (#169, #207)
- fingerprint enable and status print per-surface coverage; the fingerprint-only gate parses PAM rule fields (#155)
- Keyring hand-off check for KWallet and GNOME Keyring; openSUSE and renamed-substack wiring fixes
- gdm-fingerprint gains the keyring release pair so a fingerprint login opens the wallet
- camera-tune is reachable from the TUI with an upfront cost explanation (#170)
- mean_step consent discriminator recorded with the evidence, strobe-aware (#101)
- TUI: all machine probes moved off the UI thread; slow-TPM machines get a responsive TUI and a visible profile list
- pamwire split into submodules; origin_tests flake fixed structurally (#194)

* Thu Jul 30 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.7.2-1
- IRLUME_IR_EMITTER is checked against the camera's descriptor before any write
- Login transactions in the machine API: plan, apply, verify, rollback
- IR frames are classified by the camera's illumination flag, not by brightness

* Wed Jul 29 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.7.1-1
- Security: irlume no longer searches for an IR-emitter control by writing
  guessed values to UVC extension units. That search destroyed a reporter's
  camera (#159) and ran unattended: from 0.1.0 on enrolment, from 0.3.0 on every
  daemon start. Discovery now reads the camera's USB descriptor, addresses only
  Microsoft's documented camera-control unit and only selectors it advertises,
  builds the value from the camera's own answers, and runs only when asked.
- Configurations written by the old search are refused on upgrade.

* Tue Jul 28 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.7.0-1
- Camera arbitration: an authentication is no longer queued behind preview work
- Versioned read-only JSON machine API for desktop integrations
- Consent gesture: measured thresholds, discoverable prompts, diagnosable refusals
- Daemon hardening: per-uid refusal throttle and a wedged-capture watchdog
- ly display manager support
- Fix: the control socket is reachable again from a user-context PAM stack

* Fri Jul 24 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.6.1-1
- Update resilience: login self-heal survives an inactive watcher and a
  pre-marker upgrade; doctor warns on an unrecognized display manager; a pinned
  camera pair re-anchors by device identity after a udev renumber.
- Pre-release audit hardening (bitwarden setup, doctor install-hygiene, TUI
  Ctrl-C, recovery passphrase floor) and liveness fail-closed on a missing
  challenge model.
- Model weights are fetched from the models-v1 release (Source2-5), off Git LFS.

* Thu Jul 23 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.6.0-1
- Face-approve app prompts via polkit (Bitwarden biometric unlock, pkexec) with
  a deliberate consent gesture (head nod, or eye closure after calibrate-closure);
  fingerprint coexistence (face OR fingerprint); distro-update PAM self-heal
  (login reconcile + irlume-reconcile.path); doctor login-keyring probe.
- Security: pam_irlume ignores IRLUME_SOCKET in setuid contexts (local root fix).

* Tue Jul 21 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.5.0-1
- Field-hardening release: Tier-1 signed-PCR sealing fix with automatic
  tier upgrade, fingerprint robustness batch, IR format negotiation
  (Y16/NV12/YUYV), PAM panic firewall, hardware-validated in CI

* Tue Jul 21 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.4.0-1
- New: RGB pixel-format negotiation (NV12 alongside YUYV); MJPEG-only cameras
  get a clear error and an `irlume doctor` diagnosis instead of failing at
  capture. Doctor now recognizes Intel IPU6/IPU7 cameras and warns when a user
  is enrolled but no greeter is wired.
- New: consecutive-failure throttle (`IRLUME_RATE_LIMIT`,
  `IRLUME_RATE_COOLDOWN_SECS`) on the login/sudo and keyring paths, and an
  informed opt-in for the anti-spoof blink challenge at enrollment (default
  off), toggleable in the TUI Settings screen with `[c]`.
- Security: a remote (SSH) session no longer fires the local camera; stage-2
  fusion weighs RGB by real brightness again; the dark path enforces the
  per-user depth floor; sealed key/recovery files are created at mode 0600
  atomically. The daemon unit is sandboxed and stops within 10s.
- Fixed: malformed `pcrlock.json` hex, a non-finite detector score, and a
  truncated IR frame no longer panic the daemon.
* Sun Jul 19 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.3.0-1
- New: `irlume uninstall` (CLI and TUI) removes irlume the way it was installed,
  un-wiring PAM and stopping the daemon first so a box is never left locked out,
  then removing the package (dnf/apt/pacman/source) and cleaning residual repo
  and drop-in files. The TUI asks for a typed-word confirmation.
- New: opt-in third-party liveness models via `irlume models`, fetched from the
  publisher on the operator's machine, SHA-256 pinned, never shipped or warranted;
  wired deny-only. See ADR-0001 criterion 4 and docs/pad-results.
- New: NixOS module (`nixosModules.irlume`) with per-greeter PAM wiring.
- Merge-aware enrollment reaches the TUI: enrolling a face already known adds the
  scans to that profile instead of creating a duplicate; one face is one profile.
- Fixed: on Arch the IR emitter self-heals at daemon startup, and the PAM
  include-layout wiring is corrected.
- Fixed: the PCR-signature parser rejects non-ASCII hex instead of panicking
  (root-daemon hardening, found by fuzzing).
- A batch of TUI fixes from a full micro-audit: deliberate y/n confirmations,
  correct merge-prompt rendering, a static footer with a scrollable activity
  panel, and scroll-handling fixes.

* Thu Jul 16 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.2.1-1
- irlume enroll now merges into the profile the captured face already matches,
  adding the scans instead of refusing with "this face is already enrolled".
  This makes plain `irlume enroll` the working upgrade remedy the 0.2.0 notes
  promised for restoring dark/dim login.
- The enroll capture is sized to the matched profile's free scan slots: a
  profile with 5 slots left gets a 5-scan top-up instead of a 10-scan session
  that discards half, and a full profile is refused after one probe scan.

* Wed Jul 15 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.2.0-1
- BREAKING: re-enroll needed for dark/dim (IR) login. The IR adapter was
  removed (its training data was research-only), so IR templates enrolled under
  0.1.x no longer match. Bright-light (RGB) login keeps working and the password
  is unaffected; run `irlume enroll` to restore dark/dim login.
- Removed the research-only-trained ir_adapter.onnx; the default IR path is raw
  AuraFace plus per-enrollment on-device calibration (no bundled weights).
- Detection cascade: BlazeFace short-range rescue on a YuNet miss (saturated
  outdoor frames), FaceMesh upgraded to the 478-point FaceLandmarker mesh.
- Presence grace window after the consent gesture (15s login/lock, 5s sudo/su),
  retrying only presence-class failures.
- cargo-deny license gate enabled; dead ndarray dependency dropped.
* Sun Jul 12 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.1.5-1
- Tier 2 TPM sealing via systemd-pcrlock: on a pcrlock-provisioned machine new
  seals bind to the pcrlock NV index, so a firmware/Secure Boot update needs one
  `make-policy` re-run instead of a re-arm. Sealing tries signed, then pcrlock,
  then the literal PCR-7 policy, round-trip-verifying each; existing envelopes
  are untouched until the next arm/reseal.
- `status`, `diag`, and the TUI name the seal tier and warn on PCR drift.
- TUI fix: Activity history scroll (PgUp/PgDn) now works mid-operation and
  mid-enrollment; the Welcome [i] identify key works in the default view.
- tss-esapi builds from the archledger fork (7.7.0 + PolicyAuthorizeNV wrapper +
  upstream PR #530 session-leak fix), pinned to an exact commit.
- Opt-in IR ambient subtraction gate reworked against a real sunlight dataset.

* Tue Jul 07 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.1.4-1
- Distribution/maintenance release (face auth unchanged): `irlume update` now
  adapts to distro, install channel, and CPU arch, and reports the real
  installed package version; universal .deb for Ubuntu derivatives; Arch makepkg
  git-lfs fix; deterministic PPA orig; declared MSRV raised to Rust 1.88.

* Tue Jul 07 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.1.3-1
- Every major login manager profiled for on-demand face auth (GDM/SDDM/LightDM/
  greetd/COSMIC/Plasma Login); `irlume logs` + IRLUME_LOG=debug diagnostics.
- Directional, per-user auto-calibrated enrollment guidance; 5 scans; frontal
  framing enforced at capture. TUI hint bar.
- Security: peer-authenticated 1:N identify; redacted journal deny lines.

* Sun Jul 05 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.1.2-1
- First-run: daemon enabled+started at install (systemd preset + %%post);
  irlume-selinux pulled in by default (Recommends) and the daemon restarts
  after policy load so the greeter can reach the freshly labeled socket.
- TUI: essential-view wizard, enroll auto-starts a stopped daemon and
  resumes, [w] wires login from the Done tab, version subcommand.
- login disable --apply now always unwires /etc/pam.d/sudo.

* Sat Jul 04 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.1.1-1
- Copr pipeline fixes: enable_net for cargo, committed Cargo.lock,
  bindgen/pkg-config BuildRequires, SELinux policy built from source.

* Thu Jul 02 2026 archledger <archledger236@gmail.com> - 0.1.0-1
- Initial package: daemon + CLI + PAM module, bundled models, SELinux subpackage.
