# Every systemd unit must be shipped by every packaging lane, and every lane

#
# This exists because the same bug has now shipped three times. 0.6.x installed
# irlume-reconcile.timer on Fedora but left it out of the rpm's %files, so the
# build broke. PR #98 existed solely to resync version fields that had drifted.
# And the 0.7.0 pre-release audit found the PPA lane installing the reconcile
# .path and .service but not the .timer, which is the one that catches a config
# regenerator replacing a file by rename: PPA users would have had self-heal
# that silently missed the exact failure it was built for.
#
# A unit that is added to three lanes and forgotten in the fourth is invisible
# until someone on that distro hits it. This makes it a build failure instead.
